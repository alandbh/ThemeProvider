# ThemeProvider Playground

![theme-provider-rec-1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1545896/98623280-1a11d500-22ea-11eb-867a-10b4b52a2f8b.gif)

Just some experiments using React + Styled Components and ThemeProvider for a brand new Design System which is under development by the IXD team at [ITX Corp](https://itx.com/).

All those components we can see in this demo were created from scratch, including the sliders, color selector and switches. 

This demo aims to illustrate the power and flexibility of Styled Components and ThemeProvider.

## Check It Out

Just run the demo and play around by changing some properties of the design system like **Primary Color**, **Elevation**, **Corner Radius** and switch between **Light** and **Dark** mode.

[You can run the demo here](http://aurorapoc.surge.sh/)


## Getting Started

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
